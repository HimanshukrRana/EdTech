        question: "Who is a Full-Stack Developer?",
        answer:
          "A Full-Stack Developer is a software developer who is familiar with working with all layers of an application – the presentation layer also called the front-end of the website/application, the logic layer which is referred to as the back-end, and the logic layer. All of these layers comprise a bundle of technologies that are needed to complete a project, which is why it is referred to as a stack. Full-Stack Developers being jacks-of-all-trades web development, have seen a 35 percent increase in demand annually since 2015—small wonder that this breed of developers is so highly sought-after by start-ups and enterprises.",
